Product Description:

Less buttoned up, more low-key... Introducing the new shirt collection. Our design team spent months perfecting and wear-testing our new classic fit to get the silhouette just right. We like to think of it as the ultimate "everyday" shirt. Every bit as perfect as an under-blazer layer as it is with jeans, this fit has a little extra room, a just-right length, and warm weather-friendly short sleeves. And it's the details that make this shirt truly special—like the custom label and precise, refined topstitching. Plus, we crafted it in our customer-favorite chambray cotton. By buying cotton products from J.Crew, you're supporting more responsibly grown cotton through the Better Cotton Initiative.
